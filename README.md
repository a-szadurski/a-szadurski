My name is Arkadiusz Szadurski. I am currently learning to code in Java with bits and pieces of frontend where I need it.
Currently I slowly poke at my personal projects, as well as I have embarked on a quest to complete coding challenges
to improve my ability to create algorithms and solutions to problems that can be encountered no matter the framework or
coding language. 
Professionally, I am eager to, in the best case scenario, find an internship that will teach me even more, and allow me
to become a fully fledged developer.
