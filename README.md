My name is Arkadiusz Szadurski.  
I am currently learning to code in Java with bits and pieces of frontend where I need it.  
Currently I slowly poke at my personal projects, as well as I have embarked on a quest to complete coding challenges to improve my ability to create algorithms and solutions to problems that can be encountered no matter the framework or coding language. My profile can be found at https://coderbyte.com/profile/aszadurski . I am also attending a course  
in Node.js/React, starting on 28th of June 2021.
