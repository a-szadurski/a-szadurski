My name is Arkadiusz Szadurski.  
I am currently learning to code in Java and the basics on Node.js/React, the latter I am currently learning at a CodersLab course as part of my fullstack learning package (Java   backend + Node.js for increased frontend familiarity). I finished my Java course in May, and the JS course will take between 28th of June till 28th of August.
